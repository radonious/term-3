# Usable Logger and Time/Data classes

## Labs list: 
1) Creation of both **Logger** and **Time** classes with their basic methods
2) Creation of inherited classes (**ConsoleLogger** and **FileLogger** inherited by **Logger** interface, **Data** inherited by **Time**)
3) Added some basic exception cases and exception handlers
4) Added some binary and unary operators overloading for all classes
5) Added support of IOS << and >> operators (write/read from stream, write/read from normal/binary file)
6) Added support of **ConsoleLogger** and **FileLogger** template classes creation (idea: Control object modifications through logger)
7) Creation of Builder and Iterator patterns for **Data/Time** and **Logger** classes respectively. Also bringing the code base to the principles of SOLID.
